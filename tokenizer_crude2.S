// 2022-05-18T22:34-07:00 Current status:
// Seems to give correct left-whitespace mod 16 answer for all tested inputs.
// Now how should I keep track of running byte offset, such that final result
// can be a combo of in-vector offset + combined length of all vectors that
// have come before?

// Problem 1: lambda doesn't know how big SIMD_WIDTH is, and I think it lacks
// any access to the generator's copy of running byte offset.

// Problem 2: (orthogonal to the above) How can I keep track of an offset in
// a way that allows LoopBail, "end of data", AND "never run" to all
// ensure a "not found" response â€” instead of getting the running byte offset
// confused with a "found here" indicator?
// I toyed with "keep byte offset negative, then flip sign on find" but one
// major problem there is that zero has no negative value.
// Solution might depend on having a 2-vector accumulator.
// But solution to problem 1 might change the playing field for problem 2,
// so I should focus on that one first.

// 2022-05-16T08:20-07:00 Current status:
// I have a lot of debug verbosity, ofc.
// echo "@" | ./compile_optimized.sh tokenizer_crude2
// gives 0 correctly, but
// echo " @" | ./compile_optimized.sh tokenizer_crude2
// gives 0 when it should give 1. Must pore over verbosity to debug.
